        <p>
            It depends on your overall background. We have to consider other factors, such as your age, your highest education, your ties with your home country, what program you wish to study and how long it has been since your last education. This tells a visa officer if you have a real and temporary intention to study in Canada.

        <h1>How do I know when my temporary resident status expires?</h1>
        <p>
            When you arrived in Canada and gave your passport to the officer, they placed a stamp in your passport and/or issued another document. Check your passport.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if the officer placed a hand written date as shown above, your temporary resident status would expire on that date (June 30th, 1993 in this case).
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is no stamp, a handwritten date or document in your passport, your temporary resident status will expire six months from the day you arrived in Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you were given a visitor record, study or work permit, the expiry date is marked on the document.

        <h1>How many kids can I bring with a visitor visa?</h1>
        <p>
            Each child needs to obtain their own visitor visa, but you can submit your visa application and your children's visa application(s) together.

        <h1>I stayed in Canada longer than I was supposed to. How do I restore my status as a visitor?</h1>
        <p>
            In some cases, if it’s been less than 90 days since your visitor status expired, you can apply to restore it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use your document checklist to get the forms and documents you need. When you complete the Application to Change Conditions or Extend Your Stay in Canada as a Visitor (IMM 5708), make sure you:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Select Restore my status as a visitor (under section 3 at the top of the form).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Give details of your situation and the reason you stayed in Canada longer than allowed (under section 2 of the background information).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            You must also pay the restoration fee
        </p>
        <p>
            If it has been more than 90 days since your status expired, you can’t restore your status, and you must leave Canada

            If it is a multiple-entry visa and it has not expired, you can use it to enter Canada for both business and tourism. If it is a single-entry visa, you will need a new visa
